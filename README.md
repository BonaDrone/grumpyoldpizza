This is a clone of Thomas "GrumpyOldPizza" Roell's 
[arduino-STM32L4](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) repository, modified
to work with Ladybug Flight Controller board. Unless you are working with that specific board, you
should be using the [current version](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) of Thomas's repository.

If you do have a Ladybug Flight Controller board, follow the directions on our 
[wiki](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/wiki) to install this modified version.
